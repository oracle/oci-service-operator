# OCI Service Operator for Kubernetes

## Introduction

The OCI Service Operator for Kubernetes (OSOK) makes it easy to create, manage, and connect to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) resources from a Kubernetes environment. Kubernetes users can simply install OSOK and perform actions on OCI resources using the Kubernetes API removing the need to use the [OCI CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm) or other [OCI developer tools](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/devtoolshome.htm) to interact with a service API.

OSOK is based on the [Operator Framework](https://operatorframework.io/), an open-source toolkit used to manage Operators. It uses the [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) library, which provides high-level APIs and abstractions to write operational logic and also provides tools for scaffolding and code generation for Operators.
